When you've developed a C++ application or library, you often want to distribute it to end users in a way that's easy for them to install. Depending on the target platform, several packaging and distribution methods are available:

### 1. **Windows** :

* **MSI (Windows Installer)** :
  * A common package format for Windows.
  * Uses the Microsoft Software Installation framework.
  * Can be created using tools like[WiX Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/),[Advanced Installer](https://www.advancedinstaller.com/), or[InstallShield](https://www.revenera.com/install/products/installshield).
* **EXE (Executable Installers)** :
  * Custom installers that are self-extracting and self-installing.
  * Tools like[Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) or[NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System)](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page) can create them.
* **Appx / MSIX** :
  * Modern package format for Windows 10 and onwards.
  * Can be distributed via the Microsoft Store.
  * Supports both Win32 and UWP apps.

### 2. **Linux** :

* **.deb** :
  * Used primarily by Debian and its derivatives like Ubuntu.
  * Tools:`dpkg-deb`,`debhelper`.
* **.rpm** :
  * Used by Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS, and their derivatives.
  * Tools:`rpmbuild`.
* **AppImage** :
  * Provides a way to distribute applications in a single file that's executable on many Linux distributions.
  * Doesn't require installation; users just run the AppImage file.
* **Flatpak** :
  * A software utility for software deployment, application virtualization, and package management.
  * Targets multiple distributions and abstracts the base system.
* **Snap** :
  * A software packaging and deployment system developed by Canonical.
  * Allows cloud delivery and management of current versions of multiple Linux distributions.

### 3. **macOS** :

* **.dmg (Disk Image)** :
  * Common method to distribute macOS applications.
  * Users mount the disk image and drag the application to their Applications folder.
* **.pkg** :
  * Installer package used by macOS.
  * Can include post-install scripts and more complex installation logic.
* **Homebrew** :
  * A package manager for macOS.
  * Developers can create "formulae" to allow users to easily install software via the`brew` command.

### 4. **Cross-Platform Tools** :

* **CMake CPack** :
  * Part of the CMake suite.
  * Can generate various installer formats based on the platform.
* **Conan** :
  * A C++ package manager.
  * More for libraries than applications, but essential in the C++ ecosystem.
* **Qt Installer Framework** :
  * Used primarily for Qt applications.
  * Provides a way to create installers for multiple platforms.

When choosing a packaging method, consider the needs of your target audience and the platforms you're aiming for. For example, a desktop GUI application might benefit from a traditional installer, while a command-line tool could be a good fit for package managers like Homebrew on macOS or `apt`/`yum` on Linux.
