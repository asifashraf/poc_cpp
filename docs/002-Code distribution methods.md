1. **Source Code Distribution** :
   * This is one of the most common methods for C++ libraries, especially open-source ones.
   * The library's source code is shared, and users compile it themselves.
   * Examples: Boost, Eigen, and many libraries on GitHub.
   * Benefits:
     * Can be optimized for the user's specific platform and needs.
     * Can be more portable as there are no binary compatibility issues.
     * Allows users to debug into the library if needed.
   * Downsides:
     * Compilation can be time-consuming.
     * Requires users to handle dependencies and potentially complex build configurations.
2. **Binary Distribution (Shared Libraries/DLLs)** :
   * Precompiled binaries are provided, which users link dynamically.
   * Common for commercial libraries or ones with proprietary code.
   * Examples: Many commercial software SDKs.
   * Benefits:
     * Faster to get started with (no need to compile).
     * Can hide the library's implementation details.
   * Downsides:
     * Potential binary compatibility issues (ABI stability).
     * Platform-specific.
     * Might have dependencies on specific versions of runtime libraries.
3. **Package Managers** :
   * Package managers automate the process of downloading, building, and linking C++ libraries.
   * Examples: Conan, vcpkg, and CMake's FetchContent.
   * Benefits:
     * Makes it easier to manage dependencies.
     * Can handle both source-based and binary distributions.
   * Downsides:
     * Might not cover all libraries.
     * Library authors need to provide and maintain package configurations.
4. **Header-only Libraries** :
   * Some C++ libraries consist of just header files.
   * No need for separate compilation; the library is included directly into the user's project.
   * Examples: Many Boost libraries, Catch2 (for testing).
   * Benefits:
     * Extremely easy to integrate.
     * Portable.
   * Downsides:
     * Every inclusion potentially increases compile times.
5. **Frameworks or SDK Distributions** :
   * Used especially in larger platforms or ecosystems.
   * Might include binaries, headers, documentation, and tools.
   * Example: Qt Framework.

Each method has its trade-offs, and the best approach often depends on the nature of the library (e.g., open vs. proprietary), the target audience, and the platforms supported.

For open-source projects, sharing the source code (possibly along with header-only components) on platforms like GitHub is prevalent. This open approach allows for community contributions, portability across platforms, and flexibility in integrating the library into various projects.
